    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers.

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "### Question 1 - Naive Predictor Performace\n",
    "* If we chose a model that always predicted an individual made more than $50,000, what would  that model's accuracy and F-score be on this dataset? You must use the code cell below and assign your results to `'accuracy'` and `'fscore'` to be used later.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

    "* When we have a model that always predicts '1' (i.e. the individual makes more than 50k) then our model will have no True Negatives(TN) or False Negatives(FN) as we are not making any negative('0' value) predictions. Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "### Logistic Regression:\n",
    "#### Application: \n",
    "Image Segmentation and Categorization\n",
    "#### Strength:\n",
    "simple to understand, output has probabilistic interpretation, algorithm can be regularized to avoid over-fitting, models can be updated easily with new data using stochastic gradient descent\n",
    "#### Weakness:\n",
    "tends to under-perform when there are multiple or non-linear decision boundaries and outliers.\n",
    "#### Why:\n",
    "features in our dataset after normalizing and transforming looks without any outlier and the intuition was to apply a simple model to know some practical minimal results that are better than naive predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SVM:\n",
    "#### Application:\n",
    "Face-detection and handwriting recognition\n",
    "#### Strength:\n",
    "Controlling over-fitting using hyperparameters, for non-linear relations\n",
    "#### Weakness:\n",
    "long training time for large dataset, difficult to understand and interpret the final model, variable weights and individual impact and thus tuning hyperparameters may be difficult\n",
    "#### Why:\n",
    "The intuition was to check if a complex model that trade-offs quality for speed, delivers a better result than a simple linear model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adaboost:\n",
    "#### Application:\n",
    "By default Adaboost uses Decision Trees as a classifier and from the lectures we understand that Decision Trees are good options for Recommendation Engine\n",
    "#### Strength:\n",
    "works well with original data, implicit feature selection, balances well between bias and variance, suits well for both linear and non-linear data\n",
    "#### Weakness:\n",
    "risk of over-fitting for noisy data, the aggregation of results of individual decision tree is not clear to the user\n",
    "#### Why:\n",
    "After trying 2 pure classifiers above, the intuition was to try an ensemble technique that uses aggregated output of\n",
    "an existing pure classifier (decision tree by default). This was chosen over RandomForrest as the F score was higher with the default settings.\n",

    "Reasons for choosing Adaboost:\n",
    "Adaboost gives the best F-score of 0.72 with test data while LogisticRegression and SVC returns 0.68 and 0.67 respectively. Even the accuracy is highest (85.76%) compared to LogisticRegression (84.16%) and SVC (83.71%).  \n",
    "SVC performs worst in terms of prediction and training time. And only for prediction time, LogisticRegression perfroms better than Adaboost, but this difference is in milliseconds and thus can be ignored.  \n",
    "Thus, Adaboost algorithm suits this dataset because of its low train & prediction time and without comprising on the accuracy and F-score. Being an ensembler, it also gives an added advantage of hyperparameter tuning and thus a possibility to increase the F-score (a measure of precision when beta = 0.5) even further.\n",

    "The original dataset is divided into 2 sets, set X containing all the rows with features such as age, education_level, marital_status etc. and set Y (or label) containing the rows with income information for the corresponding row in X set.\n",
    "Both the sets are further divided into 2 sets, training and test sets for training and testing phases. \n",
    "So, in total, we have 4 sets, X_training, X_test, Y_training and Y_test.  \n",

    "+ Step1: Assign an initial weight to each input in X_training set\n",
    "+ Step2: Train a weak learner on random rows from X_training. A weak learner (or base classifier) is any classifier that classifies a person to be likely donor depending upon his/her attributes such as age, education, occupation etc. As training output, each weak learner creates its classification boundary and a vote associated with it that represents error made by this learner\n",

    "+ Step5: Repeat steps 2-4 until all weak learners (defined by user) have been trained or accuracy cannot be increased further\n",
    "+ Step6: Create the final classification model by summing up the individual learner's result times the associated vote. If the dataset sub-space sums up to +ve, then it belongs to class A (>50K) and when negative, it belongs to class B (<=50k)\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics.

This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn.
